// <-- These imply comments. They will be ignored when the script is run in the browser.

/*  This is another way to do comments.
  It allows for multiline comments.
  Comments are a great way to write notes in the script for yourself or any future developers about what is happening and why.
  This demo branch will include lots of comments to guide you as you get comfortable with javascript.

console.log(4 + 5) // looks like addition just works in javascript, so we don't even need that function!
console.log('-----')

console.log('4 + 5:')

// the above are logged in the console, so we can see them.

// play around with this script yourself, but remember, at this point -- we can only see the things we log.
// soon, we'll use this script to 'grab' things on the screen and manipulate them!
